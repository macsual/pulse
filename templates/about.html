  <h2>About Pulse</h2>
  <p>
  	Pulse is a project by Romario Maxwell based on the work of the General Services Administration that measures how Jamaican government domains are following best practices.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Pulse is also an <strong>experiment</strong> built on automated tools, and is <strong>probably not perfect</strong>. Pulse measures domains over the public internet using open source tools, and its results can be reviewed by anyone.

				<h4>
					What does Pulse measure about Jamaican government domains?
				</h4>
				<p>
					The first area Pulse measures is the use of <a href="/https/domains/">HTTPS</a>.<!--, and <a href="/accessibility/domains/">Accessibility & Universal Design</a>.-->
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="what-domains-are-being-measured">
				<h4>
					What Jamaican government domains are being measured?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Currently, Pulse uses an <a href="https://github.com/macsual/dotgov-jamaica-domains">unofficial <code>.gov.jm</code> domain list</a> as a starting point. Domains ending in other suffixes are not included at this time.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="why-https">
				<h4>
					What is HTTPS, and why does Pulse measure it?
				</h4>
				<p>
					<a href="https://https.cio.gov/faq/">HTTPS</a> provides a secure connection across the internet between websites and their visitors, and is becoming the new baseline for public web services across the internet. As part of this shift, the U.S. federal government is in the process of transitioning <a href="https://https.cio.gov">entirely to HTTPS</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that HTTPS generally <strong>does not affect</strong> whether a website is vulnerable to hacking. For more information on what HTTPS does (and doesn't do), <a href="https://https.cio.gov/faq/">visit the HTTPS FAQ</a>.
				</p>
			</li>

			<!--<li id="why-a11y">
				<h4>
					What is Accessibility, and why does Pulse measure it?
				</h4>
				<p>
					For websites, accessibility means that pages should be built according to certain standards that ensure, for example, that a visually impaired user accessing a government site through a screen reader will be able to navigate and access the same information available to a non-visually-impaired user.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Accessibility Report measures adherence to best practices for implementing accessible websites in the federal government. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The US Governmentâ€™s mission is to serve the needs of all its citizens, including the approximately 60 million who live with disabilities.
				</p>
			</li>-->
			
			<li id="fresh-data">
				<h4>When was the data last updated on Pulse?</h4>

				<p>
					All data was last measured on <strong>{{ scan_date | date("%B %d, %Y") }}</strong>.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="my-info">
				<h4>
					Your information about my domain is wrong! Can you please fix it?
				</h4>
				<p>
					If you just changed something about your domain to address an issue on Pulse, be aware that data does not yet automatically refresh on Pulse, and so there may be a delay before your domain's information updates.
				</p>
