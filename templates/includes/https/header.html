       This data measures whether Jamaican government domains support the HTTPS protocol (<code>https://</code>), and the strength of that support. HTTPS provides a secure connection across the internet between websites and their visitors, and is becoming the new baseline for public web services.

    <p>
      Note that HTTPS generally <strong>does not affect</strong> whether a website is vulnerable to hacking. For more information on what HTTPS does (and doesn't do), <a href="https://https.cio.gov/faq/">visit the HTTPS FAQ</a>.
